# Shopify Integration

## Overview

Shopify integration provides e-commerce metrics and sales data synchronization for the Students of the Company using Growth OS analytics and reporting.

## Purpose in Project

- **Sales Data Sync**: Import revenue and transaction data
- **Customer Metrics**: Track e-commerce performance alongside learning progress
- **Business Analytics**: Correlate learning outcomes with sales results
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate combined LMS and e-commerce reports

## Setup and Configuration

### Shopify App Setup
1. Create private app in Shopify admin
2. Generate API credentials (API key, secret, access token)
3. Configure webhook endpoints for real-time data sync
4. Set required permissions for orders, customers, and products

### Environment Variables
Required secrets in Supabase Edge Functions:
- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`: Shopify app API key
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`: Shopify app secret
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Store access token
- `SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN`: Your shop domain (e.g., mystore.myshopify.com)

## Integration Points

### Edge Functions
- `shopify-metrics`: Fetch and sync Shopify data
- `validate-shopify`: Validate Shopify credentials and connection

### Data Synchronization
```typescript
// Shopify data import
const syncShopifyData = async () => {
  // Fetch orders, customers, products
  // Transform data for Growth OS analytics
  // Store in local database tables
  // Trigger analytics updates
}
```

### Webhook Handlers
- Order creation/update notifications
- Customer data changes
- Product inventory updates
- Payment status changes

## Key Objects and References

### Shopify Objects
- **Orders**: Revenue tracking and customer analysis
- **Customers**: Cross-platform user identification
- **Products**: Learning course correlation
- **Analytics**: Sales performance metrics

### Growth OS Integration
- User activity correlation with purchase data
- Learning outcome impact on sales performance
- Customer lifecycle analytics
- ROI measurement for educational content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures**
- Verify API credentials are correctly configured
- Check app permissions in Shopify admin
- Confirm shop domain format (include .myshopify.com)

**Data Sync Issues**
- Validate webhook endpoint URLs
- Check Edge Function logs for sync errors
- Verify network connectivity to Shopify APIs

**Rate Limiting**
- Monitor API call frequency against Shopify limits
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider batch processing for large data sets

### Debug Commands
```typescript
// Test Shopify connection
const testShopifyConnection = async () => {
  // Verify credentials
  // Test basic API calls
  // Validate webhook setup
}
```

## Extending the System

### Advanced Analytics
- Customer lifetime value correlation
- Product performance by learning completion
- Seasonal sales impact analysis
- A/B testing integration

### Automation Workflows
- Trigger learning content based on purchase behavior
- Automated follow-up sequences for customers
- Dynamic pricing based on learning progress
