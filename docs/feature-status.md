# Growth OS Feature Implementation Status

This document tracks the current implementation status of all features documented in Growth OS.

## Legend
- ✅ **Fully Implemented** - Feature is complete and working as documented
- 🚧 **Partially Implemented** - Core functionality exists but some features are missing
- 📋 **Planned** - Feature is documented but not yet implemented
- ❌ **Broken/Incomplete** - Feature exists but has known issues

## 🚨 Pre-Launch Critical Issues

**⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT LAUNCH PUBLICLY UNTIL THESE ARE RESOLVED**

### Security Issues (CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Launch)

1. **Data Exposure Vulnerabilities**
   - ❌ Enrollment managers can view `password_hash` and `password_display` from users table
   - ❌ `company_settings` table is readable by all authenticated users
   - ❌ `user_security_summary` table lacks RLS policies (wide open)
   - **Risk**: Credential theft, data breaches, compliance violations
   - **Fix Required**: Update RLS policies to restrict password field access

2. **Hardcoded Credentials in Source Code**
   - ❌ Supabase URL and anon key hardcoded in `src/lib/env-config.ts` (lines 4-6)
   - **Risk**: Credentials exposed in Git history and build artifacts
   - **Fix Required**: Move all credentials to environment variables only

3. **Database Security Warnings**
   - ⚠️ 3 Supabase linter warnings need review
   - ⚠️ Security Definer views need security audit
   - ⚠️ PostgreSQL version needs security patches
   - **Action**: Review and resolve all linter warnings

### Code Quality Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

4. **Production Console Logging**
   - ❌ 253 console.log/error/warn statements found across 81 files
   - **Top offenders**: ConnectAccountsDialog.tsx (20), StudentDashboard.tsx (15), Layout.tsx (12)
   - **Risk**: Performance impact, sensitive data exposure in browser console
   - **Fix Required**: Remove all console statements or replace with production logging service

5. **LocalStorage Security Risks**
   - ⚠️ Shopify domain stored in localStorage (potential XSS target)
   - ⚠️ Error data persisted in localStorage (may contain sensitive info)
   - ⚠️ Questionnaire responses in localStorage (privacy concern)
   - **Fix Required**: Review localStorage usage, move sensitive data to secure storage

### Feature Completeness Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

6. **Missing Documented Features**
   - ❌ Certificate System - Fully documented but completely missing (no tables, no UI)
   - ❌ Real-time Chat/Messaging - UI exists but no backend implementation
   - ❌ Leaderboard - Page exists but displays placeholder data
   - ❌ AI Success Partner - Documented but not implemented
   - ❌ Live Video Sessions - Scheduling exists but no video platform integration
   - **Fix Required**: Add "Coming Soon" banners or implement features

7. **Email System Production Readiness**
   - ⚠️ SMTP configuration exists but production status unclear
   - ⚠️ Email delivery monitoring not verified
   - ⚠️ Retry logic and bounce handling needs testing
   - **Action**: Full email system audit and testing

### Infrastructure Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

8. **Environment Configuration**
   - ⚠️ `.env.example` is 569 lines long (excessive complexity)
   - ⚠️ Many feature flags set to `false` by default
   - ⚠️ Some variables contain development/test values
   - **Action**: Clean up configuration, document required vs optional

9. **Missing Database Tables for Documented Features**
   - ❌ `certificates` table (for certificate system)
   - ❌ `chat_messages` table (for messaging)
   - ❌ `leaderboard_entries` table (for gamification)
   - ❌ `live_sessions` table (for video conferencing)
   - ❌ `file_versions` table (for version control)

10. **Incomplete Features**
    - 🚧 Bulk operations partially implemented
    - 🚧 Advanced analytics missing dashboards
    - 🚧 File versioning not implemented
    - 🚧 Calendar integration missing
    - 🚧 Session recording not implemented

---

**📊 Security Risk Assessment:**
- **Critical Issues**: 3 (Credential exposure, RLS vulnerabilities)
- **High Priority**: 2 (Console logging, localStorage security)
- **Medium Priority**: 5 (Missing features, config issues)
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 weeks for security hardening + feature cleanup

**✅ Recommendation**: Do NOT launch publicly until all Critical and High Priority issues are resolved.
