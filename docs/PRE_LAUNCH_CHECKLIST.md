**Estimated Time to Launch**: 2-3 weeks (with focused security hardening)

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Public Launch

### Security Hardening (Blocking Issues)

- [ ] **Fix RLS Policy - Password Hash Exposure**
  - Issue: Enrollment managers can view `password_hash` and `password_display` fields
  - Impact: Credential theft, security breach
  - Location: `users` table RLS policies
  - Fix: Update SELECT policies to exclude password fields for enrollment_manager role
  - Verification: Test with enrollment_manager account

- [ ] **Add RLS Policies to user_security_summary**
  - Issue: Table has no RLS policies - wide open to all authenticated users
  - Impact: Security data exposure
  - Fix: Add role-based SELECT policies
  - Verification: Test access with different roles

- [ ] **Fix company_settings RLS Policies**
  - Issue: Table readable by all authenticated users (should be admin+ only)
  - Impact: Configuration data exposure
  - Fix: Restrict SELECT to superadmin and admin roles only
  - Verification: Test with student/mentor accounts (should be denied)

- [ ] **Remove Hardcoded Credentials**
  - Issue: Supabase URL and anon key in `src/lib/env-config.ts` (lines 4-6)
  - Impact: Credentials exposed in Git history and source code
  - Fix: Use environment variables exclusively, remove all hardcoded values
  - Verification: Search codebase for hardcoded credentials

- [ ] **Resolve Supabase Linter Warnings**
  - Issue: 3 security warnings from Supabase linter
  - Warnings:
    1. Security Definer view without proper constraints
    2. Extension in public schema (security risk)
    3. PostgreSQL version needs security patches
  - Fix: Address each warning individually
  - Verification: Run `supabase db lint` with zero warnings

- [ ] **Audit Security Definer Functions**
  - Issue: Multiple functions use SECURITY DEFINER (bypass RLS)
  - Impact: Potential privilege escalation if misused
  - Fix: Review each function for proper input validation and authorization
  - Functions to audit: 35+ SECURITY DEFINER functions
  - Verification: Document security rationale for each function

### Code Cleanup (Blocking Issues)

- [ ] **Remove All Console Logging**
  - Issue: 253 console.log/error/warn statements across 81 files
  - Impact: Performance degradation, sensitive data exposure
  - Priority files:
    - `src/components/ConnectAccountsDialog.tsx` (20 statements)
    - `src/components/StudentDashboard.tsx` (15 statements)
    - `src/components/Layout.tsx` (12 statements)
    - `src/pages/ShopifyDashboard.tsx` (10 statements)
  - Fix: Remove or replace with production logging service
  - Verification: Search for `console.log|console.error|console.warn`

- [ ] **Replace console.error with Proper Error Logging**
  - Issue: Error details logged to browser console
  - Fix: Implement centralized error logging service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
  - Verification: No console.error calls in production build

- [ ] **Implement Production Logging Service**
  - Options: Sentry, LogRocket, Datadog, CloudWatch
  - Requirements: Error tracking, performance monitoring, user session replay
  - Configuration: Set up environment-specific logging levels
  - Verification: Test error capture and reporting

### Data Security

- [ ] **Review LocalStorage Usage**
  - Current localStorage items:
    - Shopify domain (XSS risk)
    - Error data (may contain sensitive info)
    - Questionnaire responses (privacy concern)
  - Fix: Move sensitive data to secure storage (encrypted, httpOnly cookies, or session storage)
  - Verification: Audit all localStorage.setItem calls

- [ ] **Implement Secure Storage Pattern**
  - Requirements: Encryption at rest, secure key management
  - Consider: Supabase secure storage or encrypted localStorage wrapper
  - Verification: Security audit of storage implementation
