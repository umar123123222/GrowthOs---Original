### Code Cleanup (Blocking Issues)

- [ ] **Remove All Console Logging**
  - Issue: 253 console.log/error/warn statements across 81 files
  - Impact: Performance degradation, sensitive data exposure
  - Priority files:

    - `src/components/StudentDashboard.tsx` (15 statements)
    - `src/components/Layout.tsx` (12 statements)
    - `src/pages/ShopifyDashboard.tsx` (10 statements)
  - Fix: Remove or replace with production logging service
  - Verification: Search for `console.log|console.error|console.warn`

- [ ] **Replace console.error with Proper Error Logging**

### Data Security

- [ ] **Review LocalStorage Usage**
  - Current localStorage items:
    - Shopify domain (XSS risk)
    - Error data (may contain sensitive info)
    - Questionnaire responses (privacy concern)
  - Fix: Move sensitive data to secure storage (encrypted, httpOnly cookies, or session storage)
  - Verification: Audit all localStorage.setItem calls

- [ ] **Implement Secure Storage Pattern**
  - Requirements: Encryption at rest, secure key management
  - Consider: Supabase secure storage or encrypted localStorage wrapper
