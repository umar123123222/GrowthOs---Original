# Admin Role

## Overview

Admins handle day-to-day operations of Growth OS, including student management, financial tracking, content oversight, and system administration.

## Core Capabilities

### Student Management
- **Student Creation**: Add new students with payment plans
- **Status Management**: Activate, suspend, or modify student accounts
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track student performance and completion
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple students simultaneously

### Financial Operations
- **Payment Processing**: Mark installment payments as received
- **Invoice Management**: Generate and track payment invoices
- **Payment Plan Configuration**: Set up installment options

### Content Management
- **Module Administration**: Create and organize learning modules
- **Assignment Management**: Set up and monitor assignments
- **Recording Management**: Upload and organize video content

### Support and Communication
- **Support Ticket Management**: Respond to student inquiries

- **Mentor Coordination**: Oversee mentor-student relationships

## Access Permissions

### Full Access
- All student records and progress data

- Content creation and modification
- Support ticket management and responses
- System analytics and reporting

### Limited Access
- Cannot modify superadmin-only settings
- Cannot access global system configurations
- Cannot manage other admin accounts
- Cannot access sensitive audit logs

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access controls limit scope to operational functions
- Activity logging tracks all administrative actions
- Financial operations require explicit permissions
- Student data access governed by privacy policies
