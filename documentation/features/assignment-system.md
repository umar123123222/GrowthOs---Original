## Progress Integration

### Content Unlocking

The assignment system serves as progression gates:

```sql
-- Trigger function for content unlocking
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_submission_approval()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'approved' AND OLD.status != 'approved' THEN
    -- Unlock next recording in sequence
    PERFORM unlock_next_recording(NEW.student_id, 
      (SELECT recording_id FROM assignments WHERE id = NEW.assignment_id)
    );
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

SELECT s.*, a.name as assignment_name, u.full_name as student_name
FROM public.assignment_submissions s
JOIN public.assignments a ON a.id = s.assignment_id
JOIN public.users u ON u.id = s.student_id
WHERE s.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY s.submitted_at;

-- Verify assignment configuration
SELECT a.*, al.recording_title 
FROM public.assignments a
LEFT JOIN public.available_lessons al ON al.id = a.recording_id
WHERE a.is_active = true
ORDER BY a.sequence_order;

-- Check unlocking status
SELECT * FROM public.user_unlocks 
WHERE user_id = 'student-uuid'
ORDER BY unlocked_at DESC;
```
